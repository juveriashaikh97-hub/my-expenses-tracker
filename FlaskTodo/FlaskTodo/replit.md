# Overview

This is a personal expense tracking web application built with Flask. The application allows users to add expenses and view monthly spending reports through a modern, visually appealing web interface. It features a sophisticated design with gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and interactive hover states. The current implementation uses in-memory data storage for simplicity, making it suitable for development and testing environments.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Flask's built-in Jinja2 templating system serves HTML pages
- **UI Design**: Modern single-page application with sophisticated visual design including gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations
- **Form Handling**: Enhanced HTML forms with JavaScript for client-side interaction and API communication
- **Styling**: Advanced CSS with modern design patterns including:
  - Gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects
  - Soft shadows and rounded corners
  - Smooth transitions and hover animations
  - Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - Modern typography with system fonts
  - Interactive button effects with shimmer animations

## Backend Architecture
- **Web Framework**: Flask serving as a lightweight Python web framework
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following standard HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- **Data Models**: Simple expense objects with fields for amount, description, category, and date
- **Request Handling**: JSON-based API communication with proper error handling and validation

## Data Storage
- **Current Implementation**: In-memory Python data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- **Data Persistence**: No permanent storage - data resets on application restart
- **Scalability Consideration**: Designed for easy migration to database storage (SQLite implementation referenced in attached files)

## Application Structure
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between presentation layer (templates) and business logic (Flask routes)
- **Auto-generated Data**: Automatic ID assignment and date stamping for expense entries
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation for JSON payload requirements

# External Dependencies

## Core Dependencies
- **Flask**: Python web framework for routing, templating, and request handling
- **Python Standard Library**: 
  - `datetime` module for automatic date assignment
  - Built-in JSON handling for API responses

## Potential Future Dependencies
- **Database**: SQLite integration prepared (as evidenced by attached files) for persistent data storage
- **Frontend Enhancements**: No current JavaScript framework dependencies, using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

## Development Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**: Required runtime environment
- **Web Browser**: For frontend interface access
- **No External APIs**: Currently self-contained with no third-party service integrations
