Configuration
This project requires you to configure two files with your Firebase credentials: index.html (for the frontend) and app.py (for the backend).

Configure Frontend (index.html):

Open index.html.

Go to your Firebase Console, navigate to Project settings > General, and find your web app configuration.

Copy the firebaseConfig object and paste it directly into the <script> tag at the bottom of the index.html file, replacing the placeholder code.

Configure Backend (app.py):

Open app.py.

Find the firebase_config dictionary at the top of the file.

Copy the entire contents of your downloaded Firebase Service Account key JSON file and paste it as the value for the firebase_config variable.

Running the Application
Start the Flask backend server:

python app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the application.
